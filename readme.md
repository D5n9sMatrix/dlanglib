The gaussian algorithm systematically produces solutions to any homogeneous linear system,
called basic solutions, one for every parameter.
Moreover, the algorithm gives a routine way to express every solution as a linear combination of basic
solutions as in Example 1.3.5, where the general solution x becomes
