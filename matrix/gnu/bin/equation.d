/*
A similar argument shows that Statement 1.1 is true for linear combinations of more than two solutions.
The remarkable thing is that every solution to a homogeneous system is a linear combination of certain
particular solutions and, in fact, these solutions are easily computed using the gaussian algorithm. Here is
an example.
